# Useful_Things
Adding useful tools, documents, etc. I make here so others can download them.

The items I upload are free to use and modify how you wish. If you want help making something for yourself please reach out! My LinkedIn in on my GitHub and you can message me.


## Items:
### Course Tracker
- I use this tracker to capture my time worked and grades.
- This helps me be accountable for progress and delays in my programs.
- It's pretty simple, but it helps me (once I record hte time, I feel obligated to do the work for that time lol).

### Personal Finance Tracker
- I use a version of this tracker to track my income and expenses.
- You can set custom mapping for categorize expenses.
- I based the importing/mapping on what Discover exports, but you can add whatever.
